# Advanced Qualtrics for Research and Teaching

Welcome to the companion repository for the **“Beyond Surveys: Using Qualtrics for Teaching and Research”** workshop, created and led by **Dave Brocker** at Farmingdale State College.  

This repo contains materials, slides, and examples demonstrating how to use **Qualtrics** as both a **teaching tool** and a **research platform**, bridging classroom engagement and experimental design.

---

## Workshop Goals

This workshop helps educators and researchers move **beyond basic survey design** by integrating advanced Qualtrics features that enable:

- **Adaptive learning tools** for teaching  
- **Experimental control** for research  
- **Embedded data** and **logic-based flow**  
- **Custom CSS, HTML, and JavaScript** enhancements

## Structure of the Workshop

| Section | Focus | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Part I – Teaching Applications** | Engagement & Feedback | Use Qualtrics to create interactive learning experiences with text piping, adaptive branching, and auto-grading quizzes. |
| **Part II – Research Applications** | Experimental Design | Learn to embed data, randomize conditions, and automate experimental scoring and logic. |
| **Part III – The Bridge** | Teaching → Research | See how classroom tools (like feedback or quizzes) can transform into reproducible research workflows. |

## Interactive Examples

Each live demo in the slides links directly to a Qualtrics form using **embedded block URLs**.
